          erasure-coding-policy:
            title: Attributes of erasure coding policy type
            description: >
                           The "erasure_coding" policy-type use the following attributes.
                           The ec-num-data-fragments and ec-num-parity-fragments
                           attributes are used to control the level of redundancy
                           and availability of objects in this ring. The values are
                           significant to the ec-type in use. For "jerasure_rs_vand"
                           an object is stored in ec-num-data-fragments fragments.
                           An additional ec-num-parity-fragments parity fragments are
                           also stored.

                           For example, where ec-num-data-fragments is 10 and
                           ec-num-parity-fragments parity is 4, at total of 14
                           fragments are stored -- this is commonly represented as
                           (14,10). To GET an object, any 10 fragments must be available
                           in order to reconstruct the object. In space terms, the total
                           size of the fragments is 1.4 times the size of the original
                           object.

                           To chose appropriate values for ec-num-data-fragments and
                           ec-num-parity-fragments you must balance storage overhead with your
                           availability requirements. For example, if you use (14,10) and have
                           two swift-zones in the system, if all servers in a zone are
                           down, only 7 fragments are available in the remaining zone.
                           This is not enough to reconstruct your data and all GET
                           operations will fail.

                                   object servers because this much object data must be kept
                                   in memory while the erasure coding mechanisms  process
